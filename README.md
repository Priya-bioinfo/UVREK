# UVREK
This repository hosts flat files containing data from the UVREK database. UVREK is a curated collection of differentially expressed biomolecules following UV radiation exposure. You can explore the database at [UVREK](https://cb.imsc.res.in/uvrek/). For more details, refer to our manuscript on [bioRxiv](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2024.03.31.587452).
