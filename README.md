# UVREK
This repository hosts flat files containing data associated with the UVREK database. The UVREK database is a invaluable resource compiling biomolecules associated with both early and late stages of UV exposure from published studies. Users can explore the database at [UVREK](https://cb.imsc.res.in/uvrek/). For detailed information on this study, please refer to the associated manuscript in [bioRxiv](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2024.03.31.587452).
